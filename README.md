# 2018-Duke-Data-Fest

This repository for code, data, and figures were made during Duke ASA Datafest 2018. The Duke ASA Datafest 2018 was presented by Indeed.com. Indeed.com asked “What advice would you give a new high school about what major to choose in college? How does Indeed’s data compare to official government data on the labor market? Can it be used to provide good economic indicators?”. An end-to-end data analysis was conducted around these questions and the results were presented in an R Shiny App.
